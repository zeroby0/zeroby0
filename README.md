### Heyo <a rel="me" href="https://hachyderm.io/@4ravind">ðŸ‘‹</a>

I'm looking for PhD programmes involving wireless communications. If you're involved in one, please let me know of any openings via email! (`aravind.reddy@iiitb.org`)

You can find more information on my website: [www.avoggu.com](https://www.avoggu.com/)

If you have questions about [nexmon_csi](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon_csi), please [create an issue](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon_csi/issues/new) and tag me. You can also email me, but I prefer using issues because they're available to others too!

If you're looking for guides and scripts for nexmon_csi, they are available at [nexmonster/nexmon_csi](https://github.com/nexmonster/nexmon_csi/tree/pi-5.10.92) on branch pi-5.10.92. The Python framework to read and plot CSI data is on the [feature/python branch](https://github.com/nexmonster/nexmon_csi/tree/feature/python/utils/python). The picsi tool is on [nexmonster/picsi](https://github.com/nexmonster/picsi/).
